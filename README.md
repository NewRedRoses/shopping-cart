# Mock shopping cart 

Within this repository you will find an elementary React project designed by me that follows the requirements an **The Odin Project** course page. It aims to create a shopping cart using CSR and API's. To learn more regarding the Odin project instructions, checkout this page: [Project: Shopping Cart from the React course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart)
 
As of `06/23/2024` the project is considered 90% completed. Due to time constraints, I cannot afford to dedicate more time to this project. There remain a few tweaks with the styling to better accomodate different screen sizes. I have planned to get back into this down the line.

# Things to Do

Below are the remaining things I want to do in order to clean up the page as much as possible. I expect to get back into these later on.

## "Cart" page

- [ ] Fix cart page's cards rendering awkward on large & small screen sizes.
- [ ] Set a defined spot for the price total div. This way, deleting a cart item won't be as jarring.
- [ ] Save cart items on page refresh.
- [ ] On "place order" button click, reset cart and display some "confirmation" message. 

## "List all items" page
- [ ] Add padding to the "list all" page so it does not overwhelm user with all the items.
  -  Experiment: limit to 4 cards per row on large screens and a, slightly bigger, card for mobile.
